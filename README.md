# EventFull

This idea was inspired by the difficulty us students face in discovering relevant campus events with relatively busy schedules. I’ve seen that a lot of these events go unnoticed even though they’re both highly beneficial AND enjoyable for students.

Our project is a web app that allows Cal students to find events on campus that are tailored to their interests! It uses ML recommendation algorithms to give them personalized event suggestions. Each student can register, specify their interests, and eventually rate their past events to see future events for them with information like time, location, and ratings from others
